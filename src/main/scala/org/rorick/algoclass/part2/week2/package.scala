/**
 * Programming assignment for week2. It covers the following.
 *
 * KRUSKAL'S MST ALGORITHM: Last week we covered Prim's MST algorithm and a blazingly fast implementation of it. There
 * are several reasons for studying a second greedy MST algorithm, due to Kruskal. First, it's a beautiful algorithm,
 * worthy of a greatest hits compilation. Second, to obtain a super-fast implementation of it, we'll need to learn about
 * the simple but fundamental "Union-Find" data structure. The third reason is covered in the next section...
 *
 * CLUSTERING: Clustering is an important form of unsupervised learning (i.e., extracting patterns from unlabeled data).
 * These two videos discuss how Kruskal's MST algorithm suggests flexible and useful greedy approaches to clustering
 * problems.
 *
 * HUFFMAN CODES: Everybody loves compression. It means more songs on your smartphone, faster downloads, and so on.
 * Huffman coding is a fundamental type of lossless compression, used for example in the MP3 standard. In these videos
 * we'll learn about the optimality of Huffman codes, and a blazingly fast greedy algorithm for computing them.
 *
 * UNION-FIND LECTURES: This is purely optional material about advanced implementations of the union-find data
 * structure. For those of you looking for some seriously next-level (but beautiful) material, check them out when you
 * get a chance.
 *
 * The second programming assignment, also due July 20th (with 10 attempts), asks you to implement the greedy clustering
 * algorithm from lecture. For part (a), a straightforward implementation should suffice. Part (b) involves a graph that
 * is likely too big to fit in your computer's memory, so answering this part will take some ingenuity.
